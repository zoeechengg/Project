        <div class="description">
            <p>Hong Kong cuisine is mainly influenced by a mix of Cantonese, European and Chinese cusinines all together.
            Since Hong Kong has long been a part of the British colonial rule and has a long history of being an international
            port for commerce, there has been a strong influence of many Western cusinese as well.</p>
            <p>Hong Kong is well known for its Dai Pai Dongs, also known as Hawker Stalls, as well as many upscale
            restaurants throughout the city. Its been labeled a "Gourmet Paradise" because of its rich cuisines in every class.
            A few of Hong Kong's famous foods include <a href="#Street-food">Street food</a>, <a href="#Noodles">Noodle Shops</a>

            <p class="mid">
                One of Hong Kong's staple street food is <i>gai daan zai</i> (雞蛋仔), also known as egg puffs. Food stalls all over Hong Kong sell
                them and these soft puffy egg puffs have grown to include flavors of all kinds. Mammy Pancake is a well known store that uses quality 
                ingredients like eggs from Holland to make their egg puffs. Their menu includes flavors like purple sweet potatoes, matcha, red bean
                and even chocolate!
            </p>
            <p class="mid">
                Another Michelin Guide recommended store, Mammy Pancake's egg puffs are always so fluffy in the center, yet still crisp on the outside.
                They also serve waffle sandwiches with a variety of fillings like peanut butter and condensed milk. With an incredible menu like theirs, 
                Mammy Pancake is definitely a must-go for anyone.

            <p class="mid">Location: 115-117 Fuk Wa Street, Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong</p>
            <p class="mid">
                The Kwan Kee snack store has been selling sweets in the Sham Shui Po district since the 60's and their most famous snacks 
                are their red bean pudding cups. Known as <i>put chai go</i> (砵仔糕), Kwan Kee is named after the owner's father, Fu Kwan, who sold sweets
                at a street stall when Fu Wing-Cheung (the son) was a child.
            </p>
            <p class="mid">
                Red bean puddings are made of rice flour, brown sugar and red beans and steamed in little bowls. The reason why people line up
                specifically for Kwan Kee's puddings is because they grind the rice everyday into flour. Their traditional cooking methods have 
                earned the shop their reputation for authentic Hong Kong snacks. Unsurprisingly, Kwan Kee was recommended 
                for both the 2016 and 2017 Michelin Guide.

                Kiki Noodle Bar is located in the heart of the central business district, making it a perfect lunch spot for all
                the working people around the area in office buildings like Exchange Square. Kiki began as an instant Noodle
                brand and has been very popular amongst Hong Kong people. Kiki Noodle Bar offers classic Chinese dishes like
                Sichuan's dan dan noodles and a special abalone and fish maw noodles in chicken soup. Their physical store can now
                allow people to enjoy more elevated versions of Kiki instant noodles.

            <p class="mid">
                Cheung Fat Noodles is one of my local favorites for a nice bowl of noodles. Known for their simple menu with a few 
                options, Cheung Fat is famous for their classic dishes - noodles with fish balls, wonton or pork knuckle.
                Located in Shek Kip Mei as a <i>dai pai dong</i> (大排檔) or commonly known as street stalls, Cheung Fat might not seem like the most refined restaurant 
                to dine at, but locals around the area call this place a go-to. It is one of the oldest noodle shops in Hong Kong and they 
                specialize in Cantonese noodle dishes where the owner follows traditional techniques of cooking noodles by rendering his owner
                Pork Lard Oil every day to add the extra flavor in his soy sauce noodles.

            <p class="mid">
                One of Hong Kong's most famous local Michelin-starred Dim Sum restaurant not only has locations all over Hong Kong, in Sham Shui Po,
                Central, Olympic City, and so forth, but they are a internationally recognized restaurant as well, with locations in New York City
                and Singapore, to name a few. What started off as a small 20-seater restaurant in Mong Kok back in 2009, founders Cheg Mak Gui Pui and 
                Chef Leung Fai Keung promised "freshly made to order" Dim Sum. They promised to serve food at its best taste and also at an affordable 
                price. The first branch of the restaurant delivered this promise and thus made it into the 2010 edition of the Michelin Guide.
            </p>
            <p class="mid">
                Tim Ho Wan's most popular dish is their pork buns. They are not steamed like normal but instead are baked. The sticky sweet pork filling
                compliments the soft fluffy exterior of the bun with a crackling sugary crust. It is one of the best pork buns I have ever had and definitely 
                worth the long waits at their store locations.
