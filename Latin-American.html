                Latin American cuisine is the typical food common to the countries and cultures of Latin America. The
                spices used in the dishes
                are what make Latin American flavors so distinct. One of the more popular Latin American cuisines in
                Hong Kong is <a href="#Mexican">Mexican</a>
                food, which more so hails from the Central American region.

                11 Westside is opened by L.A.'s very own Taco King, Esdras Ochoa, who started his career opening his
                taco truck in LA. After visitng Hong Kong
                and receiving an offer from his new business partners, he opened up 11 Westside in Kennedy Town. The
                restaurant has seating indoors
                and outdoors, with a "speakeasy" at the back of the restaurant. Not only are the tacos there made from
                traditional ingredients, but
                Ochoa also learned to use some local ingredients to create specials like pork-belly taco.

            <p class="mid">Location: 20A D'Aguilar St, Central, Hong Kong</p>
            <p class="mid">
                Tucked into a narrow side street off of Lan Kwai Fong's main D'Aguilar Street, Brickhouse is a late
                night Mexican bar
                and restaurant. They offer a taco sharing platter where diners can choose 5 of Brickhouse's
                signature tacos featured on the menu which is good for sharing. Brickhouse also offers late night
                "brunch" on Saturday nights from 8-10:30pm, includes free flow and unlimited
                servings of a range of dishes that Brickhouse does best. The restaurant has a very chill vibe, great for
                catching up with
                friends and good location for social gatherings. Although their food is packed with flavor, the
                restaurant setting
                might not be for everyone. It's dimly lit and cosy, definitely a hidden gem (the fact that it's
                literally hidden
                in a back alleyway).
