<h2>About Website</h2>
<hr> 
<p>
    I have always loved trying new types of food and disovering the best restaurants wherever I go. In a city 
    like Hong Kong, where I grew up, there are always new restaurants constantly opening up. This website is 
    going to be based on my past experiences dining in Hong Kong and what I think are the best places to go to.
</p>
<p>
    Objective: This would be an informative website for Hong Kong residents or travlers planning on visiting
    Hong Kong in helping them decide or offering recommendations as to where they should go for good food.
</p>
<p>
    Target Audience: (1) Hong Kong residents looking for new restaurants to try. (2) Tourists planning on coming to 
    Hong Kong.
