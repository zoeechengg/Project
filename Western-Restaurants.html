                Western cuisine, also known as European cuisine, generally refers to the cuisines of Europe and other
                Western countries like
                the Americas as well. Hong Kong has a good variety of such cuisine, with many overseas restaurants
                opening their own location
                in Hong Kong. One of the more popular western cuisines in Hong Kong are <a href="#Italian">Italian</a>,

                208 Ducentto Otto is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Hong Kong. The restaurant's decor makes
                this modern restaurant
                a go to for fancier meals with family and friends. With a bar on the first floor and the restaurant
                seating on the second floor,
                208 Ducentto Otto is a great location for good food and drinks. The pizzas served at the restaurant are
                made to the specifications of
                The Association Verace Pizza Napolentana, using on buffalo mozzarella from Campana and the freshest
                ingredients in a pizza oven shipped
                straight from Naples.

                Pici is well know and prides themselves on their freshly made pasta daily. Although their pasta menu is
                limited, they
                serve fresh hand-made pasta dishes made with the finest ingredients which changes monthly. One of their
                most popular
                appetizers is the Homemade Meatballs which combines both pork and beef, which I think is absolutely
                delicious. Since their menus
                change from time to time, and their pastas are all homemade and fresh, Pici offers a good variety of
                authentic Italian food in cozy
                dining setting.

                Orginating from the New York City's Carbone, this Hong Kong location plays homage to Italian comfort food. 
                Chef Mario Carbone brought Greenwich Village's Carbone all the way to Hong Kong with generous American sized portions.
                Their service and food surely live up to its reputation. Waiters toss salads, carve Parmesan cheese from the giant wheel,
                and present their dessert cart all tableside, so restaurant goers get a chance to see everything in action.
            </p>
            <p class="mid">
                Carbone's signature dish includes the spicy vodka rigatoni as well as Mario's meatballs. The vodka rigatoni is my absolute favorite
                at this restaurant. The pasta is perfectly cooked to al dente and you get a little kick from the chili peppers that add the "spice".
                Although the price is a little steeper, I think that Carbone is definitely worth it and I will be back again for that spicy vodka 
                rigatoni.

                At Kinship, guests can enjoy American inspired dishes and dine in an elegant yet relaxing atmosphere. With the open kitchen 
                concept and the idea of "family", where friends and family can gather for a casual meal, chefs Arron Rhodes and Chris Grare have
                come up with Kinship and its farm-to-table concept. This means all the ingredients are locally sourced.
            </p>
            <p class="mid">
                My experience at Kinship was extremely enjoyable. All the dishes were very good, but I personally liked the burnt onion risotto 
                and the sticky pork belly. Both dishes have such unique flavors that I haven't seen at other similar restaurants before.

                Located in Mira Moon Hotel in Wanchai, Supergiant Tapas and Cocktail Bar is the go-to place for sharing

                They offer a larger variety than the usual tapas restaurants, including pastas, risottos and meats from
                the grill.
