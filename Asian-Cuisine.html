                "Yakiniku" stands for grilled meat in Japanese and this is exactly what this restaurant does best. With
                grills in the center of each
                table, Yakiniku Great's focus is on its meats. They offer different cuts of the cow, cooked at specific
                times and paired with
                different sauces for each cut. It is clear how much effort and thought is put into each slice of meat
                served at Yakiniku Great,
                and the servers can either cook them for you or you can do it yourself, which in my opinion is a lot
                more fun! The wagyu is so soft
                that it melts in your mouth the second you eat it.

                One of my favorite Japanese dishes is "tonkatsu" which is a breaded, deep-fried/tempura pork cutlet.
                Here at Porker,
                their entire menu focuses on just that. They are a specialty Japanese cutlet restaurant, serving
                different types of
                meats and seafood made tonkatsu style.

                Located in the central business district of Hong Kong and at one of the most prestigious addresses in
                Central, Zuma Hong Kong is an internationally well known contemporary Japanese Izakaya restaurant with
                locations in New York,

                With their very own garden terrace, private room and a lounge and bar, Zuma's relaxing atmopshere
                elevates the dining experience. My recommendation is to go on the weekend when they have a brunch
                special with a
                sushi/sashimi and a hot foods buffet, free flow of champagne (additional charge), a choice of one entree
                and their
                famous dessert platter.

                Focused on ingredients sourced from Kumamoto in Japan, Kappo ro ann offers fresh sushi and a new take on
                classic Japanese style cooked dishes. They are well known for their large chicken wings and raw chicken
                dish. In
                addition, Ro ann's restaurant offers sushi bar seating where sushi chefs provide meal goers with an
                unforgettable
                experience with their omakase set. The restaurant is also situated on the 28/F of iSquare (in Tsim Sha

                Tensho is another great Japanese restaurant offering anything between sushi and sashimi to izakaya
                dishes as well. It is definitely
                a solid restaurant to dine at when you want something easy and casual.

                Located in the busy party district of Hong Kong, Bombay Dreams offers classic Indian dishes with a
                contemporary twist to it. Their portions are large and meant for sharing with friends and families.
                Created by Indian chefs,
                you can definitely taste the authenticity in their foods, more specifically their fragrant desserts.
                They also offer classic cocktails that incorporate Indian spices and serve, in my opinion, one of the
                best garlic naan
                I've had.

                One of the more popular Vietnamese Pho restaurants in Hong Kong is Brass Spoon, which has earned the
                Michelin's Bib Gourmand status,
                given to restaurants who have "exceptionally good food at moderate prices". Although compared to a lot
                of the other chain Pho restaurants
                in Hong Kong, Brass Spoon is considered a little on the pricer side, they pride themselves in offering
                premium ingredients like "preimum raw beef".
                One must fill in and tick a little sheet of paper to customize the ingredients and toppings added into
                your pho. I love the fact that you are allowed
                to add more or take away certain ingredients as you please when you order the noodles and their use of
                quality ingredients.

                Compared to the rest of the rooftop restaurants and bars in the shopping mall of IFC, Glasshouse offers great prices for its 
                Asian Fusion dishes. With amazing views of the harbor in the restaurant's literal glass house structure, Glasshouse is a perfect
                spot for casual dinner with friends and family. Their menu boasts of a huge variety of dishes from mains to pastas, soup noodles, robata,
                even rice dishes as well.
            </p>
            <p class="mid">
                My personal favorite dish at Glasshouse is their duck noodle soup. Not only is the shredded duck meat juicy, but the noodle's broth
                is extremely flavorful, making this a great dish for a cold winter day.
